# üìò Module 1 ‚Äì Foundations of AI: Preprocessing, Classification & Clustering

This directory contains a series of projects developed as part of **Module 1** of the Artificial Intelligence University Diploma (DUIA) at UNICEN. The projects explore fundamental AI concepts with a focus on **data preprocessing**, **supervised classification**, and **unsupervised clustering** techniques.

## üîÑ Project Structure & Learning Progression

The development of these projects was **incremental**, building on each other progressively:

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  The initial projects focus on data preparation techniques including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection, and normalization. These preprocessing steps were not only essential for their own sake, but also formed the basis for all the subsequent models.

- **Supervised Learning ‚Äì Classification**  
  Using the preprocessed datasets, several projects tackle classification tasks using supervised learning. These include model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation across different algorithms.

- **Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì Clustering**  
  The final project in this module applies **clustering algorithms** for unsupervised learning, using previously built preprocessing pipelines to prepare and analyze the data.

## üìè Model Evaluation

Special emphasis was placed on understanding and applying **evaluation metrics** such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Silhouette Score (for clustering)

Additionally, **train/test splits** and **cross-validation** techniques were used to better assess the models and avoid overfitting, ensuring robust and reliable results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Throughout these projects, I worked with several key tools and libraries from the Python data science ecosystem, including:

- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`ydata-profiling`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling)
- and others...

These projects reflect the foundation of my work in AI, emphasizing clean data pipelines and thoughtful evaluation ‚Äì skills that were critical for the more advanced modules that followed.
