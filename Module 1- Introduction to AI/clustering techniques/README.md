# üîç Clustering Project

This folder contains a project focused on applying **unsupervised learning techniques**, specifically clustering, to a dataset composed of numerical features.

Although clustering is typically performed on data without labels, in this case the dataset includes a **known target variable** (class labels). This provided a unique opportunity to perform both:

- **External evaluation**, using the real classes as reference  
- **Internal evaluation**, simulating a real-world scenario where such labels are not available

## üß™ Project Overview

The workflow involved:

- Analyzing the dataset using visualization and statistical tools  
- Selecting appropriate preprocessing techniques based on the data‚Äôs characteristics  
- Applying various clustering algorithms  
- Comparing clustering performance through:

  - **External metrics** (e.g., Adjusted Rand Index, Homogeneity, Completeness)  
  - **Internal metrics** using:
    - **Silhouette Score**  
    - **Elbow Method**  

This dual approach allowed for a deeper understanding of how different preprocessing strategies and models behave, both in a controlled (labeled) and an unlabeled context.

This project highlights the importance of critical preprocessing and model selection decisions in unsupervised learning tasks, and how evaluation strategies must adapt when ground truth is or isn‚Äôt available.
